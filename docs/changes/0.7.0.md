# v0.7.0

* Add new `ROUTE_METRICS_PRIVATE_GOOGLEAPIS` configuration option for sending metrics and logs over `private.googleapis.com` IP addresses

## Add new `ROUTE_METRICS_PRIVATE_GOOGLEAPIS` configuration option for sending metrics over `private.googleapis.com` IP addresses

When set to `true`, the new `ROUTE_METRICS_PRIVATE_GOOGLEAPIS` variable will trigger an addition to the `/etc/hosts` file of each Knfsd Node for the following FQDN's:

* monitoring.googleapis.com
* logging.googleapis.com
* cloudtrace.googleapis.com

The IP used (`199.36.153.11`) is from the range defined in the [Private Google Access docs](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access-hybrid#config-choose-domain). This ensures that metrics and logs are shipped over a predictable IP address range that is only routable from within Google Cloud.

For most use-cases this will not be required, however this is beneficial when the default internet (`0.0.0.0/0`) route has been removed from the VPC and a specific, predictable CIDR range is required for shipping logs and metrics to Google Cloud Operations.
