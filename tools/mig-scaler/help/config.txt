NAME
    mig-scaler help config - supplementary help for config files

DESCRIPTION
    The config file uses a standard linux ini format.

    The config file is stored at:

        $HOME/.config/mig-scaler.conf
        /etc/mig-scaler.conf

    The order in which variables are applied is:

        * Config file
        * Environment variables
        * Command line arguments

    Thus an environment variable will override a value set in a config file,
    and command line arguments will override environment variables.

EXAMPLE

    This is an example config that sets all the properties available:

        format   = table
        detailed = false

        [workflow]
        project      = workflow-project
        region       = us-central1
        name         = mig-scaler
        max-duration = 8h
        max-size     = 100

        [mig]
        project   = client-project
        region    = us-central2
        zone      = us-central2-a
        increment = 10
        wait      = 1m
        duration  = 8h

DURATION FORMAT
    --workflow-max-duration, --wait and --duration accept a duration string
    in the format of a number, followed by a unit suffix. Valid time units are
    "s", "m", and "h". For example "8h", or "2m30s".

AVAILABLE PROPERTIES
    format
        Sets the --format option for use with the list command.

    detailed
        Sets the --detailed option for use with the list command. If this is
        set to true, then you can use "--detailed=false" to override it. Note
        that because this is a boolean flag the equals sign is mandatory, you
        cannot use "--detailed false" as false will be interpreted as a
        positional argument.

    [workflow]
        project
            Sets the --workflow-project option.

        region
            Sets the --workflow-region option.

        name
            Sets the --workflow-name option.

        max-duration
            Sets the --workflow-max-duration option. This affects how all
            commands search the history, see help max-duration.

        max-size
            Sets the maximum target size the client will allow when scaling
            up a MIG.

    [mig]
        project
            Sets the --project option. This sets the project for the client
            MIGs.

        region
            Sets the --region option. This sets the region for the client
            MIGs.

        zone
            Sets the --zone option. This sets the zone for the client MIGs.
            You should only set region or zone, not both. If both are set then
            region will be ignored.

        increment
            Sets the --increment option for the scale command. This sets how
            many instances are created per batch.

        wait
            Sets the --wait option for the scale command. This sets how long
            the job will wait between batches.

        duration
            Sets the --duration option for new jobs. If the job takes longer
            than this duration then the job will be cancelled.
            This cannot be greater than --workflow-max-duration.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
    The following environment variables can also be used to set properties:

    MIGSCALER_WORKFLOW_PROJECT
        Sets --workflow-project.

    MIGSCALER_WORKFLOW_REGION
        Sets --workflow-region.

    MIGSCALER_WORKFLOW_NAME
        Sets --workflow-name.

    MIGSCALER_MAX_DURATION
        Sets --workflow-max-duration.

    MIGSCALER_MAX_SIZE
        Sets --workflow-max-size.

    MIGSCALER_PROJECT
        Sets --project.

    MIGSCALER_REGION
        Sets --region. Setting MIGSCALER_REGION will override any zone that has
        been set in the config file.

    MIGSCALER_ZONE
        Sets --zone.

    MIGSCALER_INCREMENT
        Sets --increment.

    MIGSCALER_WAIT
        Sets --wait.

    MIGSCALER_DURATION
        Sets --duration.
