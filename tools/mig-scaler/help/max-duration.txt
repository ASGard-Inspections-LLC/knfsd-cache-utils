NAME
    mig-scaler help max-duration - supplementary help for the max duration
        configuration option.

DESCRIPTION
    The --workflow-max-duration setting is used when searching the workflow
    execution history for active and recent jobs.

    This can be an issue when reducing the --workflow-max-duration, as this
    could cause the scale and cancel commands to fail to find active jobs.

    For example if a job was started 6 hours ago, and --workflow-max-duration
    is set to "4h", the active job will not be cancelled when submitting a new
    job, and will not show in the list command.

    To avoid this issue, ensure all scaling jobs have finished before reducing
    the --workflow-max-duration setting.

    When a job is submitted, the job also has its own --duration setting. This
    normally defaults to --workflow-max-duration, and cannot be greater than
    --workflow-max-duration. If the job takes longer than --duration then the
    job will cancel itself and mark the job as failed.

USING THE GCP CONSOLE
    If you are having issues and think that there might be an active job still
    running that is not showing up you can use the GCP console.

    * In the GCP console go to Workflows.

    * Select the workflow used to run the scaling jobs.
      This is normally mig-scaler.

    * Select the EXECUTIONS tab.

    * In the filter above the table enter: "state:Running"

    This will show a list of all running jobs, to cancel a job click on the
    Execution ID of the job, then click the CANCEL button in the top bar.
