NAME
    mig-scaler scale - scale up a client MIG

SYNOPSIS
    mig-scaler scale [FLAGS] NAME TARGET

DESCRIPTION
    mig-scaler scale will start a job to scale a MIG up to the requested
    target. Any existing active jobs for the MIG will be automatically
    cancelled and replaced by the new job.

    When searching the workflow execution history for active jobs to cancel,
    scale will stop searching when --workflow-max-duration is reached.
    See help max-duration.

    Once launched the job runs asynchronously, mig-scaler does not wait for
    the job to finish.

EXAMPLES

    To scale up a client MIG:

        $ mig-scaler scale example-instance-group 50

    To scale up a MIG at a different rate:

        $ mig-scaler scale example-instance-group 50 \
        --increment=20 --wait=5m

    To scale up a regional MIG:

        $ mig-scaler scale example-instance-group 50 --region=us-central1

    To scale up a zonal MIG:

        $ mig-scaler scale example-instance-group 50 --zone=us-central1-a

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
    NAME
        The name of the client MIG to scale up.

    TARGET
        The target size to scale the client MIG up to.

FLAGS
    --increment=INCREMENT
        How many instances to start per batch. The default is 10. This cannot
        be greater than --workflow-max-size. --workflow-max-size should be set
        to an appropriate value in the config file, see help config.

    --wait=WAIT
        The duration to wait between each batch. The default is 1m.

    --duration=DURATION
        The maximum duration of the job. If the job takes longer than
        DURATION then the job will be cancelled.
        Defaults to the value of --workflow-max-duration.

GLOBAL FLAGS
    The following global flags are supported:
    --workflow-project
    --workflow-region
    --workflow-name
    --workflow-max-duration
    --workflow-max-size
    --project
