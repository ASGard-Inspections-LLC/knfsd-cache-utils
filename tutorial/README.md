# Knfsd cache utils tutorial

**Note:** The files in this Tutorial sub directory are for use with the single-node/Quickstart tutorial "[Deploy a kernel space NFS caching proxy in Compute Engine][tutorial]."

This tutorial guides a user through the step by step process of deploying a pared-down, fully self contained test environment. It foregoes the usage of Terraform and uses simplified startup scripts. It also removes many of the advanced features you might want to use for configuring the system in your environment.
